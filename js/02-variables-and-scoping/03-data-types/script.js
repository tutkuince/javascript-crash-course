// String - Sequence of characters. Must be in quotes or backticks
// Number - Integers as well as floating-point numbers
// Boolean - Logical entity / true or false
// Null - Intentional absence of any object value
// Undefined - A Variable that has not yet been defined / assigned
// Symbol - Built-in object whose constructor returns a unique symbol
// BigInt - Numbers that are greater than the "Number" type can handle

//
// Reference Types (Objects)
//
// Reference types or "objects" are a non-primitive value and when assigned to a variable,
// the variable is given a reference to that value.
// Object literals, arrays and functions are all reference types
